 * When XML started, the notion of a namespace was rarely used (and

 * Unfortunately, the XML SAX readers, the event-driven parsers people
 * tend to use, at least as underlying structures have become more complex.
 * At any rate, a qualified name consists of 1) the local part (that is

 * the prefix for the namespace, which presumably maps to a namespace URI
